Problem 1: The time range of a query might not correspond to the block time range.

Instead of defining f with queries, for a given timepoint, we define the aggregate frequency for all attributes
for time t1, attribute a is accessed x time, attribute b is accessed y times

Problem 2: The adaptation scheme doesn't take into account frequencies.

Problem 3: We haven't really defined m.

TODOs:
- bg will do (1) and (3).
- rjs will do (2).
