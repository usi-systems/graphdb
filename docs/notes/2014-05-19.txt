My ideas:
- Batch read idea: not sure how the analysis would work
- tau parameter: incremental
- distributed "rail road"
  - might lose data parallelism
  - Ask: do all nodes execute in parallel?
  - How could we put more machines together?
    -> use less machines per graph

Bugra:
  - Disk support for Weaver?
  - Pregel: all in memory, checkpointing to disk
  - Pregel is not resident in memory, 
    load the graph, run the query, may modify the graph

  - In Weaver model: the graph is resident
    - They don't allow the query to modify the graph
    - Then they have batch updates for writes

Bugra:
  - Please send papers
