TODOs:
- (bg) Unit test of optimal solver
- (bg) Add query weights to paper
- (bg) Write up list of experiments
- (rjs) Add query weights to optimal solver
- (rjs) Implement experiment to show I/O overhead
- (rjs) Implement experiment to show solving time

Potential experiments:

1. I/O overhead
optimal vs single partition vs. attribute per partition
Compute the I/O for different workloads,
3 values averaged at the end
Also compute the storage.

What will compute the I/O?
Partitioning->Workload->I/O

2. # of attributes vs solving time:
with optimal vs. heuristic
