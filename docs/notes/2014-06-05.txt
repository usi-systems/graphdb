- Bugra: let's combine the overlapping algorithms so that
  the comparison is parameterized by a utility function.

  - Someone might say "what if there are too many queries?". We could 
   cluster (using similarity and k-means) and then run the same algorithm.

- Bugra: non-overlapping case. Let's start with everything in a single
  partition, and then try to divide.
  Question: what is the heuristic for how to divide?
  Maybe we could look at hierarchical clustering algorithms.

- Weaver: 
  - Maybe we can add something more? 
  - Something about storage (SSDs, fast storage)
  - Maybe set up a meeting with Gun?

TODO: 
- Robert: different alternatives for utility
         - Maximizing reduction in query I/O
         - Maximizing reduction in query I/O per reduction in overhead
         - Similarity
         - Frequency
- Bugra: work on non-overlapping case
- Bugra: send me a bunch of refernces
