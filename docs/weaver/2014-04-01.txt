RJS and EGS meeting, April 1, 2014

- Titan graph db
- Graph queries
- Weaver: sharded, large scale graph store.
  Let's you update the underlying db, with the changing db
- ACID guarantees
- Transactions, and versions


- Why is neo4j not sufficient?
- What about graph lab (not transactional)?

- At what rate does he think the network is changing?

- Provenance questions: 

Migration for in-memory graph store:

Greedy is fairly resilient, but there are other problems..

Next step: migration policies are all dependent on workload
characteristics.

---------------------------------------------------------

Node programs: take weaver, write some node programs to do 
some things like what mothy wants to do.

Start thinking about a migration  

* Can I get access to the weaver code? 

Give me a week...

Hi Gun, 

It was great talking to you today. I wanted to send a follow up email with our todos:

egs - Send me a draft of the Weaver OSDI submission.
egs - Send me access to the Weaver code (when convenient).

rjs - Think more about the graph db applications, and possibly Weaver "node programs".
rjs - Talk more with Mothy about their data model.

egs & rjs - Start thinking about a migration

thanks, 
Robert
